We do not know these attributes and therefore they are often refered to as *hidden features*, *latent features* or *embeddings*. We can assume that this latent space has a significantly lower dimensionality than our ratings_matrix. One way to find these features is to use the Matrix Factorization to create two low dimensional matrices that multiply to our ratings matrix. This can be seen as a kind of compression. One classic MF is SVD. In this case we want to reduce the dimensionality so we use truncated svd.\n",
